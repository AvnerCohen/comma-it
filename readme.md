Comma-It.js
===========

Tiny module to turn numbers into a more readble amounts by adding commas:
> 1234.5  => 1,234.50


At some point in time it's very easy to add support for multiple precisions and setup for precision and thousands seperator char, these are different in different parts of the world ofcourse.
